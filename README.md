Project Description: Credit Risk Prediction App : https://kamwanaanalyst.shinyapps.io/creditapp101/
This project involves the development of a Credit Risk Prediction app using R's Shiny framework. 
The app leverages a Random Forest model trained on a credit risk dataset to predict the likelihood of a loan default based on user inputs such as age, income, loan amount, credit score, and gender.
The app's user-friendly interface allows users to input their financial information and receive instant predictions about their credit risk.
The model's performance is evaluated through accuracy metrics, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, ensuring its reliability. 
Additionally, the app is deployed on shinyapps.io, allowing for easy accessibility and user interaction over the web. 
This project serves as a practical demonstration of machine learning applications in finance and showcases the power of interactive data visualization in helping users understand their financial health.
